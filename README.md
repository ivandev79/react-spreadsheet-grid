## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] and should be installed as one of your project's `dependencies`:

```
npm install --save react-spreadsheet-table
```

## Basic usage

```jsx
import { Table, Input, Select } from 'react-spreadsheet-table'

class MySpreadsheetTable extends React.Component {

  render() {
    return (
      <Table 
        /* Define columns of the table and how they get their values */
        columns={[
          {
            title: 'Name', 
            /* Define the props of components based on { active, focus, disabled } of the cell state */
            value: (row, { active, focus, disabled }) => {
              return (
                /* You can use the built-in Input */
                <Input  
                  value={row.name}
                  active={active}
                  focus={focus}
                />
              );
            }
          }, {
            title: 'Position',
            value: (row, { active, focus, disabled }) => {
                /* Also, you can use the built-in Select */
                <Select  
                  value={row.positionId}
                  isOpen={focus}
                  items={positions}
                />
            }
          }, {
            title: 'Manager',
            value: (row, { active, focus, disabled }) => {
              return (
                /* Also, you can use ANY OTHER components as a content for the cells */
                <Autocomplete  
                  value={row.managerId}
                  active={active}
                  focus={focus}
                />
              );
            }
          }
        ]}
        
        /* Define rows */
        rows=[{
          id: 'user1',
          name: 'John Doe',
          positionId: 'position1',
          managerId: 'manager1'
        }, {
          id: 'user2',
          name: 'Doe John',
          positionId: 'position2',
          managerId: 'manager2'
        }]
        
        /* Define a unique key getter for a row */
        getRowKey={row => row.id}
      />
    )
  }
}
```

## Props

### columns

```jsx
arrayOf({ 
    id: string / number, 
    title: string / func, 
    value: string / func(row, { active, focused, disabled }) 
}) 
``` 
> defaults to `[]`

> `isRequired`

This is the most important prop that defines columns of the table. Every item of the array is responsible for the corresponding column. `title` is what you want to put in the header of the column, it could be passed as a string or as a func returning a React element. `value` works the same way, but func receives `row` and current state of the cell (`{ active, focused, disabled }`) as parameters, so you can create an outpur based on them.

### rows
> `arrayOf(any)` | defaults to `[]`

> `isRequired`

This is an array of rows for the table. Every row will be passed to a `column.value` func (if you use it).

### getRowKey
> `func(row)`

> `isRequired`

This is a func that must return *unique* key for a row based on this row in a parameter.

### placeholder
> `string` | defaults to `"There are no rows"`

Used as a placeholder text when the `rows` array is empty.

### focusedCell
> `{ x: number, y: number }` | defaults to `null`

The cell with this `x, y` coordinates (starting from `0`) will be rendered as a focused cell initially.


### checkDisabledCell
> `func(row, columnId): bool`

Use this func to define what cells are disabled in the table. It gets `row` and `columnId` (defined as `column.id` in a`columns` array) as parameters and identifiers of a cell. It should return boolean `true / false`. A disabled cell gets special CSS-class and styles. Also, you can define a `column.value` output based on the `disabled` state parameter.

### onCellClick
> `func(row, columnId)`

A click handler function for a cell. It gets `row` and `columnId` (defined as `column.id` in a`columns` array) as parameters and identifiers of a cell.

### headerHeight
> `number` | defaults to `40`

The height of the header of the table in pixels. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Define it as a prop, not in CSS styles to not broke the scroll of the table. ‚ö†Ô∏è

### cellHeight
> `number` | defaults to `48`

The height of a row of the table in pixels.

‚ö†Ô∏è Define it as a prop, not in CSS styles to not broke the scroll of the table. ‚ö†Ô∏è

### columnsResize
> `bool` | defaults to `false`

Switch this on if you want the table has columns with resizable width.

### onColumnResize
> `func(widthValues: array)`

A callback called every time the width of a column was resized. Gets `widthValues` object as a parameter. `widthValues` has values of width for all the columns and a width of the table itself.


### columnWidth
> `arrayOf(number)`

Pass this array if you want initialize width of columns. A number value at every index should be a percent value of width for the column with the same index. For example, it could be `[ 50, 25, 25 ]`. Also, you can get it from `onColumnResize` callback to store somewhere and use for the next render to make columns stay with the same width.


## Customizing CSS styles

Right now, the easiest way to tweak `react-spreadsheet-table` is to create another stylesheet to override the default styles. For example, you could create a file named `react_spreadsheet_table_overrides.css` with the following contents:

```css
.SpreadsheetTable__cell_active {
    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 2px green;
}
``` 

This would override the color of borders for the table active cell.

‚ö†Ô∏è The only exception, that you have to use `headerHeight` and `cellHeight` props to redefine height of the header and rows to not broke the scroll of the table.


## Customizing cells & header content

You can use any React component as a content of titles and cells, just pass it as a result of `title` and `value` functions of elements of the `columns` props. Setting these components using `row` and `{ active, focus, disabled }` parameters of the functions. 

For the basic usage, the library provide 2 default components that you can use out-of-the-box: `Input` and `Select`.

An example of the usage:

```jsx
import { Table, Input, Select } from 'react-spreadsheet-table'

 <Table 
    columns={[
      {
        title: () => {
            return <span>Title</span>
        }, 
        value: (row, { active, focus, disabled }) => {
          return (
            <Input  
              value={row.name}
              active={active}
              focus={focus}
            />
          );
        }
      },
   ]}
/>
```

## Performant scrolling

`react-spreadsheet-table` always renders only the rows that are visible for the user. Therefore, you can pass to it as many rows as you want - it will work fine without any problems with rendering and scroll.
